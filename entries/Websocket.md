## WebSocket

**WebSocket** is a computer [communications protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol "Communications protocol"), providing [full-duplex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-duplex "Full-duplex") communication channels over a single [TCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol) connection. The WebSocket protocol was standardized by the [IETF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force "Internet Engineering Task Force") as [RFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFC_(identifier) "RFC (identifier)")  [6455](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455) in 2011. The current API specification allowing web applications to use this protocol is known as _WebSockets_.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket#cite_note-1) It is a living standard maintained by the [WHATWG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Hypertext_Application_Technology_Working_Group "Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group") and a successor to _The WebSocket API_ from the [W3C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium "World Wide Web Consortium").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket#cite_note-2)
